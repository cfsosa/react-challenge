Setup a default React app.
Add routing and Redux for state management.
Create a login page. On the login page, we won’t need to authenticate to the backend, but if there is a valid email and the password is “ApployMe,” consider the user authenticated. Store this in the Redux state and redirect to a home page

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
